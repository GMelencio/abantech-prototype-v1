                                The visualization capacity of 3D technology is a great fit for healthcare professionals. Being able to evaluate a patient's condition with a skeletal scan in a 3D model is a bit like having x-ray glasses.

                                But while it may be a good fit, it doesn't always feel like an easy fit. Efficio is the bridge between the two.

                                We work with healthcare providers to bring stronger diagnostic capabilities to their practice by using gesture control devices (NUI) from 3D games to capture biometric measurements of joints, muscles and tendons. Medical professionals can model range of movement – right in office - to better understand the extent of an injury. The resulting 3D model makes it easy to share information with other docs – plus it’s a great training tool.

                                Efficio is able to connect any device to any other system (like a computer or network.) We use the system to track incremental progress, exporting from 3D to alternate file formats, such a patient chart.

                                All by using commercially-available off-the shelf hardware. All in real time.
