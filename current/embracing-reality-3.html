                                Modeling is a 2D business, with flurries of activity followed by a long, unproductive wait to render output in 3D. Though CAD applications revolutionized the field over 40 years ago, not a lot has changed since that roll out.  The applications are still complex, hard to learn and expensive to replace.

                                Efficio cuts through all of it - total disruption.  By incorporating functionality of NUI devices, rendering is a thing of the past. Users work directly in 3D without mouse or menus.  Use hand gestures and voice commands to move, revise or swap out components.  Plus, there's nothing to replace, so no costs for new applications.

                                Increase productivity and encourages creativity. Share model with customers, using innovative technology that highly skilled workers crave. Given the talent wars in the market place, that alone is a win-win.
