                                Enhancing communications is an ongoing priority every company and Virtual Reality is a natural fit. That’s why we’re partnering with Agora to deploy Efficio on <a href="http://agoravr.com/" target="_blank">their new Siminar platform</a>.
                            </p>

                                Siminars are the next step up from Webinars, using VR applications and devices to allow 3D interaction between attendees. Remote teams of employees, sales calls with clients, discussions with vendors – replicate face to face engagements in a VR environment.

                                Gone are the days of sharing a flat 2D slide presentation.  If you’re discussing the architectural structure of the Eiffel Tower, participates can experience it walking up the steps.  A sales call can become a 3D product demo. A team meeting on product packaging has 365-degree visibility.

                            <p class="text-left">
                                Efficio is what makes the Siminar concept practical for deployment and adoption.  It creates a device agnostic environment – in other words, no one is tied to any particular system or device.  If the Design team in California uses a Vive controller but the Marketing team in NY prefers a Kinect NUI -  no problem.

                                Efficio’s Bring Your Own Device integration reduces the Total Cost of Ownership -  retaining existing tech investments instead of forcing replacement to a standardized system.

                                Efficio allows different spatially-aware devices and Natural User Interface devices to communicate in a 3D environment.  The potential for innovation tools and environments is almost unlimited.

                            <blockquote class="text-left">
                                "But the Siminar is just the first step. Efficio makes it easy to build almost any multi-user virtual reality application on top of the Agora platform. It could allow 3D modelers to work on assets together. It could allow interior designers to place furniture around a space. It would allow building contractors to share 3D progress updates with clients. And that’s the beginning. Training, education, sales, collaboration and even eventually an entirely virtual office can take place on Agora using Efficio."
