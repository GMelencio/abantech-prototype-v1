                                A leading plastic surgeon’s office, the <a href="http://www.gwpsa.com/">Greater Washington Plastic Surgery Associates</a> helps hundreds of patients a year with injuries to the tendon, ligament of muscle issue that may or may not affect joint function.  Depending on the results of a medical exam, patients may require an x-ray. MRI or sonogram to determine the extent of the damage.  Patients are often the primary source of information on the their injury, responding to traditional pain scales and range of movement estimates.

                                Abantech met with <a href="http://www.gwpsa.com/about-dr-mehan">Dr. Vineet Mehan M.D.</a> to demonstrate how they could use NUI devices to capture biometric measurements of a human hand joints.  Using Efficio, Abantech was able to use both the Leap Motion Controller and the Intel SR300 capture movement and measure the total range of flexion and extension in the hand joints of a subject (patient).  The data is streamed to the device software, which applies a series of complex mathematical algorithms to further the accuracy of measurements taken by applying corrections to the captured data.

                            <p class="text-left">
                                Without Efficio, the devices' uses have seen much less practical use beyond demonstrations or prototypes. But now that same functionality is being used to capture motion from a post-operative torn tendon. Efficio uses the data captured from either or both devices to very accurately capture the range of motion as the patient opens and closes a fist, sending it to a display device where a 3D model is rendered for real-time viewing of the measurements being taken.

                            <p class="text-left">
                                The doctors can share the model with other consulting physicians and with the patient. No other medical device is needed.  The incremental data capture from the beginning to end of the patient’s treatment provides a comprehensive record of the initial condition and the progress through the healing process.  The data is incorporated into a chart.

                            <p class="text-left">
                                The outcomes are well received.  Patients can more easily understand their condition because they can see the model. The doctors have a simple diagnostic technology that utilizes innovative methods for patient care.  Plus, the project deliverable serves as new training tool, as well as a vehicle for collaboration with other medical professionals.
