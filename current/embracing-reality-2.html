                                The defense industry was among the first to adopt 3D technology as a training tool, simulating dangerous situations that require split second judgments. Police officers and other first responders at home also use 3D tools to train for scenarios – incorporating multiple variables to determine the best response.

                                Efficio facilitates the process of invention and discovery. The middleware’s rapid prototyping model significantly reduces the complexity of integrating data from disparate systems.  Efficio is device-agnostic – no more limitations among hardware devices or systems. The advanced rule processing and instruction routing can be “bolted-on” to increase the utility of the systems.

                                Efficio can facilitate and expedite the development of exercises, simulations and events that can strengthen response during real-time events.
