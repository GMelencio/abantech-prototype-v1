                                How the human body moves is the basis for every Natural User Interface (NUI) device. But different devices capture intent or information in different ways. For some it’s hand movements, others eye movements, some incorporate voice commands. This functionality interacts with a designated system. And only that system. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-left">
                                Kinect, for example, is an NUI that works with the Xbox gaming engine. When you incorporate Efficio, Kinect and any other NUI device will work with any gaming engine.  And with each other.  If you’re a game developer, imagine creating cross-functional games that work with any hardware and any device?
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-left">
                                That’s cool in itself, but it barely scratches the surface. Because what Efficio does is literally free these devices to move beyond gaming.  To work with IoT devices. To capture spatial data from any collect of endpoints and fuse it together. To collaborate and communicate remotely using any mix of devices and systems.
                            </p>

                                For developers, removing hardware constraints from devices reduces risk, opens up new markets and allows innovation the opportunity to become disruption.
