                                Enhancing communications is an ongoing priority every company and Virtual Reality is a natural fit. That’s why we’re partnering with Agora to deploy Efficio on <a href="http://agoravr.com/" target="_blank">their new Siminar platform</a>.
								Abantech has woirked with VR online collaboration start-up to transform webinars and create an immersive VR 3D alternative to flat, 2-dimensional online meetings. The <a href="http://agoravr.com/" target="_blank">Siminar application is under development at AgoraVR</a> and is aimed at creating a solution that greatly enhances particpant engagement. Abantech's intelligent fusion middleware – Efficio – helps to make the environment less complex and more accessible.

                                Siminars are the next step up from Webinars, using VR applications and devices to allow 3D interaction between attendees. Remote teams of employees, sales calls with clients, discussions with vendors – replicate face to face engagements in a VR environment.
                                The concept behind the Siminar app is to let attendees to allow attendees to use a VR headset to view the virtual online environment. Current online meeting apps mostly offer screen sharing as their primary communication tool. The Siminar platform transforms the existing concept – allowing the inclusion of 3D imagery and interactive models.  The outcome is enhanced communication and comprehension between remote teams, customers and suppliers, educators and students.

                                Gone are the days of sharing a flat 2D slide presentation.  If you’re discussing the architectural structure of the Eiffel Tower, participates can experience it walking up the steps.  A sales call can become a 3D product demo. A team meeting on product packaging has 365-degree visibility.

                            <p class="text-left">
                                Efficio is what makes the Siminar concept practical for deployment and adoption.  It creates a device agnostic environment – in other words, no one is tied to any particular system or device.  If the Design team in California uses a Vive controller but the Marketing team in NY prefers a Kinect NUI -  no problem.

                                Efficio’s Bring Your Own Device integration reduces the Total Cost of Ownership -  retaining existing tech investments instead of forcing replacement to a standardized system.

                                Efficio allows different spatially-aware devices and Natural User Interface devices to communicate in a 3D environment.  The potential for innovation tools and environments is almost unlimited.
								Abantech has helped AgoraVR by creating the Siminar Builder that allows for the creation of a web-based 3D object repository for users to upload and host images and standard-format 3D files into the virtual environment.

								Abantech uses to allow user interaction via the Gear VR's D-Pad, so users can move and control objects once they are in place.  Meeting admins and/or participants can move or manipulate objects in the environment.  As an example, in a meeting to approve the development of a subdivision, buildings could simply be moved and roads rerouted, all in 3D.

								The Siminar partnership is the start of virtual business world. <a href="https://medium.com/the-metaverse-muse/its-a-smaller-world-after-all-3ce06f9e853e" target="_blank">We see the opportunities for a virtual office, classroom, conference</a> – when an environment can be built, it can be experienced.  An example might be a professor who lectures on the Great Wall of China, while his student stroll along it.

                                "But the Siminar is just the first step. Efficio makes it easy to build almost any multi-user virtual reality application on top of the Agora platform. It could allow 3D modelers to work on assets together. It could allow interior designers to place furniture around a space. It would allow building contractors to share 3D progress updates with clients. And that’s the beginning. Training, education, sales, collaboration and even eventually an entirely virtual office can take place on Agora using Efficio."
