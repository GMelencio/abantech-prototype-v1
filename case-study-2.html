                                A leading plastic surgeon’s office, the <a href="http://www.gwpsa.com/" target="_blank">Greater Washington Plastic Surgery Associates</a> helps hundreds of patients a year with injuries to the tendon, ligament of muscle issue that may or may not affect joint function. Depending on the results of a medical exam, patients may require an x-ray. MRI or sonogram to determine the extent of the damage. Patients are often the primary source of information on their injury, using primitive tools like traditional finger goniometers to take estimated measures of their range of motion.

                            <p class="text-left">
                                Abantech met with <a href="http://www.gwpsa.com/about-dr-mehan" target="_blank">Dr. Vineet Mehan M.D.</a> to demonstrate how they could use NUI devices to capture biometric measurements of hand joints' range of motion. Using Efficio, Abantech was able to use both the Leap Motion Controller and the Intel SR300 capture movement and measure the total range of flexion and extension in the hand joints of a subject (patient). The data is streamed to the device software, which applies a series of complex mathematical algorithms to further the accuracy of measurements taken by applying corrections to the captured data.

                                Prior to this engagement, these devices have seen much less practical utilization beyond being used as human input devices (i.e. like a fancy mouse or joystick), 3D scanning, or facial recognition. However, in collaboration with GWPSA, Abantech has been able to leverage the devices' capabilities to capture motion from the post-operative repair of damaged tendons where, during recovery, a patient's range of movement improves incrementally. The system built by Abantech for GWPSA uses the data captured from either or both devices to very accurately capture the range of motion of flexion and extension as the patient moves their fingers (i.e. moving from open hand to closed fist). The data captured is read in by a display device where a 3D model is rendered for real-time viewing of the measurements being taken. At the exact same time this is happening, the system automatically to catalogs the data and consolidates it into a record of the "session". In this way, the incremental data capture from the beginning to end of the patient’s treatment provides a comprehensive record of the initial condition and the progress through the healing process.

                                With this, GWPSA has become the first user of such a system which is novel in several ways: the use of advanced technology that both obviates the need for manual measurement while automatically cataloging data, and also the use of consumer-grade hardware which intrinsically allows for wider scale deployment due to lowered up-front costs - introducing a potential paradigm shift the economic viability of medical devices for in-office and outpatient use. Additionally, with the data captured, the doctors can potentially share their observations with other consulting physicians and with the patient - in person, or remotely.

                                The system is in process of deployment as it nears closed-alpha testing. The initial system testing has shown very promising outcomes - with measurements falling within a tenth of a degree in accuracy. It is expected that the implementation will be very well received by patients, who would be able to more easily understand their condition and progress. At the same time, the staff at GWPSA will be equipped with new technology that uses innovative methods aimed at increasing the efficiency of delivering patient care. Finally, the project deliverable is may potentially serve as a new training tool, as well as a vehicle for collaboration with other medical professionals.
