                                The defense industry was among the first to adopt 3D technology initially as a training tool, simulating dangerous situations that require split second judgments. With Efficio in the mix, simulation transforms into situational awareness.

                            <p class="text-left">
                                Efficio allows raw spatial data from multiple endpoints to be captured and fused into a real-time 3D model. Data from disparate systems are combined in a singular 3D display, giving a command center a real-time view of field operations. Plotting data points based on heat signatures, GPS coordinates and facial recognition systems, command decisions can be based on comprehensive awareness.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-left">
                                Efficio is device-agnostic – no more limitations between hardware, devices or applications. No complicated system integration, add endpoints as needed to build the 3D visualization needed to fulfill the mission.
